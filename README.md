# COVID-19 Diagnosis Mobile Application

This project presents a mobile application that leverages computer vision and deep learning techniques to provide a rapid and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 through X-ray images. The application utilizes transfer learning and fine-tuning of the pre-trained Inception-V3 model on the ImageNet dataset to achieve optimal performance.

## Features

The application allows users to:

- Take X-ray images
- Receive clear and user-friendly COVID-19 detection results
- Receive COVID-19-related safety guidance reminders
- Fill out a questionnaire to aid in decision-making

The software offers better generalization results, making it particularly useful for primary screening in areas with limited test kits and medical expertise. Furthermore, the mobile app collects data that will be used by the scientific community to improve the accuracy and reliability of COVID-19 automatic screening.

## Technologies Used

- Computer vision
